========

This was created as a part of the coursework for the [Startup Engineering class on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/startup).

You can check it out live at http://smoothui.co.

The landing page there was more or less created by following along with the class, the mockup application is
entirely my own work.  If you are just interested in taking a look at that, it is basically just the following
files:

 - [public/smoothui.html](https://github.com/amclark/smoothui/blob/master/public/smoothui.html)
 - [public/js/smoothui.js](https://github.com/amclark/smoothui/blob/master/public/js/smoothui.js)
